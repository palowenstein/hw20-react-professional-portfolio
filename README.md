* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. You may we
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.
